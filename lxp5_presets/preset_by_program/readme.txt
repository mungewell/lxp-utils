Unfortunately my LXP-5 had a corrupted memory when purchased, a factory reset
proceedure jusy 'zero-ed' out the User memories.

After some searching I found the 'lxp5gl.reg' on Archive.org
https://web.archive.org/web/20010303163508/http://www.lexicon.com/downloads/lxp-5_downloads.asp

This appears to be the factory presets, but in a strange format.

On with the decoding/translation... :-)
